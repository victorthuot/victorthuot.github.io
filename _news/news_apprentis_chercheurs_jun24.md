I took part in the 2024 edition of the <a href="https://arbre-des-connaissances-apsr.org/nos-actions/les-apprentis-chercheurs/">Apprentis Chercheurs</a> program. Together with David MÃ©tivier, I supervised a pair of middle and high school students on an [introductory research project](https://dmetivie.github.io/Pluto_export/pluto_apprentis_chercheur.html) in statistics and mathematical modeling.
The 10-session programm concluded with the students presentating their work at a student science congress.
