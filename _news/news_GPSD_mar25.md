I presented the problem <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=99zsyZpUqp"> Clustering Items through Bandit Feedback: Finding the Right Feature out of Many </a> {% graf2025clustering %} for the German Probability and Statistics Days </a> (<strong> GPSD 2025 </strong>) in Dresden, Germany[<a href="https://victorthuot.github.io/assets/pdf/slides_GPSD_march2025.pdf">Slides</a>].
After this conference, I spent almost two months visiting Alexandra Carpentier in the University of Potsdam.
